# Email_Validation_program
## Features

This E-mail validation program can perform the following functionalities:

1. Detect that the first letter of the email is alphabetic or non-alphabetic.
2. It will count the number of "@" signs in your entered email because a valid email can't contain more than one or zero "@" signs.
3. It will check that the email contains a ".com" top-level domain(you can add more top-level domains but here added only ".com" and ".in"). 
4. And it will also check that the entered email should only contain either ".com" or ".in" top-level domain(note: you can enter more top-level-domain).
5. Also it will make sure to not consider an email right that contains a "space", "_" or a "." (Except in top-level domains like ".com").
6. And if any condition described above is proven false then the program will give a valid error with a specific error code.
7. Moreover, the program will ask to input "1" or "0" if there is any error. If the user will input "1" then the program will give a proper reason because of which our email is proven wrong 
and if the user will input "0" then it will exit the program.

## Requirements To Run The Code:
1. Anything that can run python code can run this program. Because it contains no External libraries.
